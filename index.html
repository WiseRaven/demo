                good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or

            <h4>    Infringement Notification</h4>
            <p>To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written
                communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior
                agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that you
                may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you
                materially misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your copyrights.
                Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes
                your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
                Your communication must include substantially all of the following:
                <br> 1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
                behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
                <br> 2. Identify in sufficient detail the location of copyrighted work that you
                believe has been infringed upon (for example, "The copyrighted work at
                issue is the text that appears on this website") or other information
                sufficient to specify the copyrighted work being infringed. If multiple
                copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single
                notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
                <br> 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the
                subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to
                which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit
                us to locate the material.
                <br> 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining
                party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an
                electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be
                contacted.
                <br>5. The following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the
                material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright
                owner, its agent, or the law."
                <br>6. The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the
                information in the notification is accurate, and that I am the copyright
                owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
                right that is allegedly infringed."</p>
